# Flow_tools_2
This is the beta version for a sculpting addon to help save time by helping easy basemesh generation

I find that the name was somewhat bad so I renamed it to Sculpt Toolkit.
An more up to date version will be available soon.

Check my [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/JeanModeler)(portuguese) page to know what I am doing!
Or if you wanna support the creation of this addon, please consider buying it on [Blender Market](https://www.blendermarket.com/products/sculpttkt---a-tool-kit-for-sculptors), I am literaly coding this alone by now and really glad your support.
